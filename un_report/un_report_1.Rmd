```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r simple addition, echo=FALSE}
2+2
```

Did you know that in R, the sum on 2 and 2 is "r four`". This is an example of inline code.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

This report was prepared to the attention of the UN. It was analyzes the relationship between a country's GDP, its life expectancy, and C)2 emissions. Our goal is the determine to what a degree a country's economic strength or weakness is related to its public health status and impact on climate pollution. WE hypothesize that both life and expectancy and CO2 emissions increase with the country's GDP

```{r data, included=FALSE}
gapminder_1997 <- read_csv(here("data/gapminder_1997.csv"))
```

```{r gdp_lifeexp_1997, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder_1997, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, 
                                  color = continent, size  = pop/1000000))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x="GDP perCapita", y="Life Expectancy", title="Do people in wealthy countries live longer?", sice = "Population(in Millions)")
