## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

gapminder_data <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv")


*Make a scatter plot of year vs pop seperated by contiennt*
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(here)
```

```{r data, included=FALSE}
gapminder_data <- read_csv(here("data/gapminder_data.csv"))
```

```{r}
gap_data_wo_outliers <- gap_data %>%
    filter(country, )
ggplot(data = gapminder_data, aes(x = year, y = pop))+
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(vars(continent))
```
